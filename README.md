# UFOs Sighting Webpage

## Project Overview:
The project was develop a webpage with dynamic table for UFO sighting information and allow users to filter the table with multiple criteria functions like date, city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results:
Through the process of UFO sighting data gather into `data.js` and along with functions coded into `app.js`, I was able to built a webpage with `index.html` sourcing back to both JavaScript files.

## Summary:
The UFO Sighting webpage is running but like most things could use continous improvement with added button for filter search reset and updated coding to retain search results information even if the webpage is refreshed.
